*   **Interactive Form:** Includes a form that mimics data recovery steps, requiring the user to fill in fields for their name, email, and a message describing the issue.
*   **"Submit" Button:** Clicking the "Submit" button triggers a redirect to a separate page.
*   **Prank Reveal:** The redirect page displays a large laughing emoji and a message revealing it as a prank.

**Technologies Used:**

*   **HTML:** For the basic structure and content of the webpage.
*   **CSS:** For styling the page (red background, text formatting).
*   **JavaScript:** For handling the button click event and redirecting the user.
